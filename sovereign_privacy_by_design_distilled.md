# Self-Sovereign Privacy By Design, Distilled

November 2017

*(This is a high-level overview of a more detailed document, [Sovereign Privacy by Design](self_sovereign_privacy_by_design_v1.md).)*

Digital credentials are exciting, but they raise privacy concerns that were only latent with their physical counterparts. Given mass surveillance, proliferating cybercrime, and bulk correlation and data mining, defeatist attitudes toward privacy are unacceptable. Strong privacy is a prerequisite for true self-sovereign identity. We can and must achieve it.

## Guiding Principles

**_Control_** for identity owners ~ **_Protection_** of secrets ~ **_Barriers_** against abuse ~ **_Usability_** for all
