## Credential Notice
When an issuer is making a change that affects its credential holders, it should let them know of the change. This could be because that the Issuer is updating its Credentials to a new schema, or rotating its public keys, or some breach was detected and credentials issued between a certain date period need to be reissued, or a particular credential was revoked (e.g, driver privileges suspended due to court order). This is done by sending the credential holder(s) a Credential Notice message.
