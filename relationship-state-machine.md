# Relationship State Machine

A relationship is the way in which two or more people or things are connected. A state machine is a system that manages the transition between valid states. Events are inputs into a state machine that may cause transitions (changes in state). An indentity owner has a unique DID for every relationship he is part of.  
So in a 2 person relationship, there are two DIDs, one owned by each person.
