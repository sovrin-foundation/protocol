# Agents

Agents are dedicated to supporting one *Owner* (person or organization), which is perpendicular to modern web infrastructure and horizontal architectures in general. An agent is aligned to one and only one Owner, and everything it does is in direct support of that one Owner.

Agents come in two basic flavors: (1) Edge Agents and (2) Cloud Agents.

### Edge Agents
An owner's Edge Agents, also known as Local Agents, are Sovrin-aware code (perhaps in the form of an SDK) running on a device in direct control of the owner. Devices include mobile phones, tablets, PCs, and servers controlled by enterprises.

### Cloud Agents
An owner's Cloud Agents are any of its agents running on hardware physically controlled by another party.
