# DID

A decentralized identifier is a new type of globally unique identifier which are fully under the control of the DID subject with  cryptographically verifiable ownership.  DIDâ€™s resolve to DID Documents in similar ways as uniform resource names (URNs) except they do not
require a central registration authority, identity provider, or certificate authority.

## DID Format
DIDs follow the same basic pattern as the URN specification. The key difference is that with DIDs the namespace component identifies a DID method, and a DID method specification specifies the format of the method specific identifier:

The Sovrin DID method namestring is sov. The identifier is the base58 encoding of a 128-bit number using the BitCoin/IPFS alphabet. For example, a Sovrin DID can generated by base58-encoding the first half of an Ed25519 verification key.

## DID Document
DID infrastructure can be thought of as a global key-value database in which the database is all DID-compatible blockchains, distributed ledgers, or decentralized networks. In this virtual database, the key is a DID, and the value is a DID document. The purpose of the DID document is to describe the public keys and service endpoints necessary to bootstrap cryptographically-verifiable interactions with the identified entity.  
A DID and DID document are created, resolved, and managed on a system using a specific DID Method. DID methods define how DIDs work within a specific environment. All DID method specs must define the format and generation of the method-specific identifier.

## The Sovrin DID Method Spec
DIDs written to the Sovrin ledger will follow the requirements defined in the [Sovrin DID method spec](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/spec/did-method-spec-template.html).

## Public (Global) DIDs on Sovrin 
Public (Global) DIDs are created and updated in Sovrin using a [NYM](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/24a86c5ebf86a2aed26f12c3db0dfc6667137d11/docs/transactions.md#nym) transaction.
