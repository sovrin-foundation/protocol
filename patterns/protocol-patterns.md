# Protocol Patterns
As we've modeled the various interactions between parties in the Sovrin protocol, patterns have emerged. Patterns are useful in that they allow us to reason about specific use cases in the context of other use cases just like them. The solution to a problem in one use case can apply nicely as a solution to other use cases that follow the same pattern. Patterns allow us to declare general solutions to problems and create and maintain a smaller and better tested codebase. 

## Peer-to-peer Patterns
 
### The Negotiation Pattern 
This pattern allows two parties to asynchronously negotiate the transference of a matter (data) with a clear set of states. These states allow both sides to encapsulate intent and remain in control.

This protocol was developed with the intended use with sovrin anonymous credentials (connections, credentials, and proofs). Those three use cases are quite different in material but have common elements in their product. 

Examples:
1. Credential Issuance
2. Proof Presentation

#### Elements
The following are higher level constructs that are used in the pattern description.

##### Matter
The matter is the element that is being negotiated. This matter must have meaning to both parties and that meaning is understood outside of this framework. That understanding is important to the use of the protocol but not the framework itself. For example, a party that is deciding whether it should agree to terms presented must interpret the semantic meaning of the matter that is being discussed. But the mechanism for the act of agreement is the same regardless of the meaning of the matter. 

#### Party Roles
During a negotiation there are two primary parties involved. There is a provider and a acquirer.  Both parties must maintain their respective control of their side of the negotiation. They both are free to agree, counter and terminate the negotiation. And when they agree, they are the two parties that must come to agreement before the matter is exchanged. 

There may be other parties involved (ex. agents) but they should facilitate communication, do automated actions against a policy, or otherwise work on behalf of a primary party.  They are not party to the negotiation outside of their relationship as an agent of a primary party member.

##### Provider
The Provider is the holder of the matter that is being negotiated. They are responsible for the delivery of the matter in the event of a successful negotiation. The Provider uses an offer to express his intent before sending the matter if the negotiation is successful.

##### Acquirer
The Acquirer will hold the matter if the negotiation is successful. The Acquirer uses requests to express his intent. The Acquirer is responsible of holding and protecting the matter once received. 

#### Message Types

##### Offer
Sent by Provider to the Acquirer. This message must provide context to the Acquirer that provides understanding about the matter. This context could express the type, kind and content of the matter. To be effective the offer should be structured such that the Acquirer can reasonably extrapolate what the matter will contain. 

For example, in a verifiable credential the offer could contain the attributes that will be bound when issuing the credential (the matter). But would not contain signatures or other cryptographic elements that make the credential verifiable and useful in proofs. 

##### Request
Sent by the Acquirer to the Provider. This message must provide context to the Provider that provides understanding about the desired matter. This context could express the type, kind and/or context that would be an acceptable matter. This context could also express agreement with the offer. This message must precede the sending of the matter.

##### Matter
Sent by the Provider. The matter message contains the matter that has been negotiated. Should match the semantics of the last request message that the Provider has agreed to. This message marks the end of the negotiation.

##### Confirmation
The Acquirer can optionally send a confirmation message after receiving the matter.  This confirmation will allow the Provider to know that the matter was received and in the possession of the Acquirer. Since this message is optional it is not reflected in the state diagram below. But this step could be required by the context of the negotiation.

##### Rejection
Either the Provider or the Acquirer can send a rejection message. This message has context after either the Provider has received a request or the Acquirer has received an offer.  Additionally, this message can be expressed as a response to any message from the other party after deciding to reject the negotiation.  This message has the basic semantics that one party no longer want to negotiate over the matter. The cause may vary but the conversation is dead. Either party can initiate a negotiation by starting a new negotiation.

##### Expired
Either the Provider or the Acquirer can send an expired message.  This message is typically expressed as a response to any message from the other party after the negotiation has expired. The expiration time should be communicated in the offer and request messages previously sent. Either part must be able to independently set an expiration time and independently enforce it.

##### Permission Certification
At any time and outside the flow of the other messages, either party should be able to ask for proof that the endpoint (eg. agents) that they interacting with is authorized by the identity owner. Maybe common for a either party to re-evaluate authorization after a long period (days) of inactivity in the negotiation (caused normal async human behavior like a weekend).

#### Negotiation State Machine
For either party the state machine is mostly the same. There are few paths that only one party can path through. For example, only the Acquirer can receive the matter while in the sent state and only the Provider can send the matter in the accepted state. But there is symmetry between the two parties in most areas of the exchange. For example, once either party sends an offer/req, it must wait for a response from the other party.

See negotiation-seq.puml and negotiation-state.puml for the sequence diagram and states of this pattern, respectively.
